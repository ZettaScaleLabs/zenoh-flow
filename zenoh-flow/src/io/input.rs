/// To access these underlying channels, two methods are available:
/// - `take`: this will return an `Input<T>` where `T` implements [`ZFData`](`ZFData`),
/// - `take_raw`: this will return an [`InputRaw`](`InputRaw`) â€” a type agnostic receiver.
///
/// Choosing between `take` and `take_raw` is a trade-off between convenience and performance: an
/// `Input<T>` conveniently receives instances of `T` and is thus less performant as Zenoh-Flow has
/// to manipulate the data; an `InputRaw` is more performant but all the manipulation must be
/// performed in the code of the Node. An `InputRaw` can be leveraged, for instance, for
